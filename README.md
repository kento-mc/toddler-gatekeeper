Local Database implementation

I set up a new database called doorOpenDB on my laptop to store records of doorOpen events. 


I granted remote access to the raspberry pi to allow records to be added to the OpenEvents table when the doorOpen event is generated by DoorDetect.py running on the pi.

First I had to create a user for the pi:
CREATE USER 'root'@'192.168.0.143' IDENTIFIED BY 'my_password';

Then I was able to grant privileges:
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO root@192.168.0.143 WITH GRANT OPTION;
